	<p>
		I've been wanting to write and host a blog for a long, long time, but I've always been
		procrastinating and giving thousands of excuses to myself... Well now it's 2025 and I've finally
		done it. Yay.
	</p>
	<p>
		So I'll (hopefully) be posting whatever thoughts/reflections I have, as I think it's great to
		log your life since it's easy to forget.
	</p>
	<br />
	<p>Also, some goals for 2025.....</p>
	<p>- finish the road trip game jam</p>
